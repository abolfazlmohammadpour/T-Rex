# ðŸ¦– T-Rex: Rule Your Terminal Like a Dinosaur!

## ðŸš€ The Vision
T-Rex is a terminal UX toolkit designed for developers who want to:
âœ” Build beautiful, interactive CLI apps without headaches  
âœ” Use ANSI magic (colors, cursor control, animations) effortlessly  
âœ” Escape boring terminal interfaces - because UX isn't just for GUIs!  

## ðŸŽ¯ Who's It For?
- CLI tool developers tired of ugly printf output  
- Pythonistas who want terminal flair without low-level hacks  
- Open-source maintainers craving a fun, memorable way to enhance their tools  
- Terminal geeks who believe a T-Rex should control their shell ðŸ¦–ðŸ’»  

## âœ¨ Why "T-Rex"?
- **T-Rex** = Terminal + Rex (Latin for "King")  
- Like a dinosaur, it's powerful, unstoppable, and a little bit wild  
- Because typing `import trex` should make you smile  

## ðŸ“œ License
T-Rex is released under the **[MIT License](LICENSE)** - one of the most permissive open-source licenses that allows:
- âœ… Free use in both personal and commercial projects  
- âœ… Modification and distribution

## ðŸ¦• Coming Soon
- Colors, animations, progress bars, and more prehistoric power  
- A minimalist API that doesn't sacrifice flexibility  
- 100% open-source - hackable, extendable, and community-driven  

ðŸ¦– **Rawr!** The future of terminal UX is T-Rex-shaped.

"Because every terminal needs a little dinosaur magic!"
